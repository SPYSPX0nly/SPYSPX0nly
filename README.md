- 👋 Hi, I’m @SPYSPX0nly  My day to day life is nerding out on cmd ine, coding, learning to be able to be the best at my craft, i have OCD and ADHD, so i love trying to figure things out from the building blocks.  MY MAIN THING DAY TO DAY IS DAY TRADING, which I actuallhy do really well at.  Only took me 3 years to finally become profitable and some small blown accounts.  So if you yall need any tips or want diretion in day trading, mainly 0DTE SPY/SPX contracts.  
- 👀 I’m interested in ... learning to code and understand why I should switch to LINUX and be done with windows, google, apple, icloud, etc.  Ideally i wanted to get a google pixel and run graphene OS, so I am interested in our last huanan right, privacy, or as the elites call it "people who have something to hide".
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... How Github works, what i should add to my new laptop to make it to be able to be full utilized.  I am well versed in website building, google anayltics, google adwords, marketing, finding ways to start online business/websites to make money since we need between 2-5 sources of income now to survive in Southern California.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...  Building startups because i have too many ideas to list and talk about.  So if anyone wants to enlighten me or get together and figure out how to live life, not just exist, I'm your guy.
- 📫 How to reach me ...  Lord_DCC@proton.me
- 😄 Pronouns: ...  I do not care, call me whatever you would like, I am a male tho and straight as a board, and also have pass no judgement on anyone, I am human just like everyone else, we are all equal. <3
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...  People think im a BRO because I surf, lift weights, snowboard, yoga, you name it i do it.  I love being outside.  However, i am obsessed with Science, Computer programming, coding, development, etc.
